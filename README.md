# VR Driver Perspective Safety Simulator  
**Author: Abhishek Dubasi**

This repository contains a simple presentation of a Virtual Realityâ€“based safety simulation environment built using Unity. The project simulates advanced driver safety systems within high-performance vehicle models - in this case, the Volvo S90.

Developed as part of a capstone research project at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Bavaria, Germany.

___

## Main Objective

To design and implement a driver-perspective safety simulation framework that evaluates driver behavior and reaction time under various road and hazard conditions. The system includes:

- Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Collision warning logic
- Pedestrian detection and avoidance
- Distracted driving scenarios
- Dynamic urban environments
- First-person VR experience
- In-cabin voice assistance

___

## Relevance to Automotive Safety

This simulator explores the evolving human-machine interface (HMI) needs in high-speed and high-risk driving contexts. It demonstrates how immersive simulation environments can support the development and validation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), including:

- Forward Collision Warning (FCW)
- Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Pedestrian response zones
- Scene occlusion handling in urban environments

___

## Role of Development  

This repository contains only the components I directly developed and implemented:

- Custom vehicle physics for realistic driving feedback
- Waypoint-based pedestrian AI and movement system
- Scene design with dynamic hazards and occlusion logic
- Meta Quest 3 integration for VR testing and interaction
- Input mapping for steering wheel and HMD support
- Voice-triggered in-cabin assistant with contextual alerts
