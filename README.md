# VR Driver Perspective Safety Simulator
<br>
This repository contains a lightweight demonstration of a Virtual Reality based safety simulation environment built using Unity. <br>The project focuses on simulating advanced driver safety systems in good performing vehicle models, which is in our case Volvo S90.
<br>
Developed as part of a capstone research project at Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Bavaria, Germany. 
<br>
## Objective of the Project

To design and implement a driver perspective safety simulation framework that evaluates driver behavior and reaction time under various road and hazard conditions. <br>The system includes:
<br>
- AEB
- Collision Warning Logic
- Pedestrian Detection and Avoidance
- Distracted Driving Scenarios
- Dynamic Urban Environments
- VR-Based First-Person Experience
- In-Cabin Voice Assistance
-

## Relevance to Automotive Safety

The system was built with reference to the evolving human-machine interface (HMI) needs in high-speed, high-risk driving environments. It explores how future hypercars could integrate immersive simulations to fine-tune their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), including:

- Forward Collision Warning (FCW)
- Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Pedestrian Auto-Response Zones
- Scene Occlusion Modeling for Urban Navigation

## My Role in Development

This repository includes only the components I personally designed and implemented, including:

- Custom vehicle physics tuned for responsive simulation feedback
- Modular pedestrian AI system based on waypoint networks
- Scene design with variable occlusion and hazard positioning
- Meta Quest 3 integration for VR testing
- Input mapping for steering wheel and META Quest 3
- Voice-triggered assistant for auditory driver feedback
